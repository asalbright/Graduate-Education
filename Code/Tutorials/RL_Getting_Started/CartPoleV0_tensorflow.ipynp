Recommended action: A probabiltiy value for each action in the action space.\n","   The part of the agent responsible for this output is called the **actor**.\n","2. Estimated rewards in the future: Sum of all rewards it expects to receive in the\n","   future. The part of the agent responsible for this output is the **critic**.\n","\n","Agent and Critic learn to perform their tasks, such that the recommended actions\n","from the actor maximize the rewards.\n","\n","### CartPole-V0\n","\n","A pole is attached to a cart placed on a frictionless track. The agent has to apply\n","force to move the cart. It is rewarded for every time step the pole\n","remains upright.
